Run-length encoding (RLE) is a very simple form of data compression in which runs of data (that is, sequences in which the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements) are stored as a single data value and count, rather than as the original run. Wikipedia

Task

Your task is to write such a run-length encoding. For a given string, return a list (or array) of pairs (or arrays) [ (i1, s1), (i2, s2), â€¦, (in, sn) ], such that one can reconstruct the original string by replicating the character sx ix times and concatening all those strings. Your run-length encoding should be minimal, ie. for all i the values si and si+1 should differ.
Examples

As the article states, RLE is a very simple form of data compression. It's only suitable for runs of data, as one can see in the following example:

runLengthEncoding("hello world!")
//=>      [[1,'h'], [1,'e'], [2,'l'], [1,'o'], [1,' '], [1,'w'], [1,'o'], [1,'r'], [1,'l'], [1,'d'], [1,'!']]

It's very effective if the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements:


/**
 * @param {string} str
 * @return array[]
**/
const runLengthEncoding = str => {
  const res = new Array()
  let count = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; ++i) {
    const char = str[i]
    if (char === str[i + 1]) {
      count++;
    } else {
      count++;
      res.push([count, char])
      count = 0
    }
  }

  return res
}

console.log(runLengthEncoding("hello world!"))
console.log(runLengthEncoding("aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbb"))
console.log(runLengthEncoding("WWWWWWWWWWWWBWWWWWWWWWWWWBBBWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWBWWWWWWWWWWWWWW"), [[12, 'W'], [1, 'B'], [12, 'W'], [3, 'B'], [24, 'W'], [1, 'B'], [14, 'W']])
